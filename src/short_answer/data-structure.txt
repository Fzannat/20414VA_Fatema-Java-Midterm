***ANSWER ALL OF THE QUESTIONS BELOW***

Why do we need data structure?
Answer: We use data structure to store and organize data efficiently.

What are the various operations that can be performed on different data structures?
Answer: Sorting, Searching, Deletion, Insertion,

When would we use data structures in the real world?
Answer: There are many ways that we can use data structure, such as use a queue to give movie ticket, or
   to store the inventory in a video game.

What is an Array?
Answer: An array is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type.

What is the difference between Array and ArrayList?
Answer: The difference between a built-in array and an ArrayList in Java, is that the size of an array
        cannot be modified (if you want to add or remove elements to/from an array, you have to create a new
        one). While elements can be added and removed from an ArrayList whenever you want.

What is a LinkedList?
Answer: Linked list is ordered collection that contains many objects of the same type.
        It can be stored anywhere in the memory. Each node contains two things:
                    Value of the element.
                    Address of the next node.


How is an Array different from LinkedList?
Answer: An array is a collection of elements of a similar data type. Linked List is an ordered collection
        of elements of the same type in which each element is connected to the next using pointers.

What is a Queue?
Answer: Queue is a collection of ordered objects.

What is a Stack (referring to data structures)?
Answer: Stack is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are
        performed.

What is FIFO and LIFO?
Answer: FIFO means first in first out. Queue follows this.
        LIFO means Last in first out. LinkList follows this.

Explain Big O Notation?
Answer: Big O Notation is a way to measure an algorithm's efficiency.
        It measures the time it takes to run your function as the input grows.

What is the best case to search an element from an array?
Answer: the best case to search an element from an array is O(1) when the element is first or last
        element in the array.

What is the worst case to search an element from an array?
Answer: the worst case to search an element from an array is O(n!)

Describe what a tree data structure is?
Answer: A tree is a hierarchical data structure defined as a collection of nodes.

Describe what a graph data structure is?
Answer: A graph is a common data structure that consists of a finite set of nodes (or vertices) and
        a set of edges connecting them.

What is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
Answer: In HashTable all methods are synchronized, but In HashMap All methods are not synchronized.
        In HashTable, at a time only one thread is allowed to operate the Hashtable’s object.
        Hence it is thread-safe, but In HashMap, multiple threads can operate simultaneously and hence hashmap’s object is not thread-safe.

How do HashMaps work in Java? How do they store values, and when are they useful?
Answer: It provides the basic implementation of the Map interface of Java.
        It stores the data in (Key, Value) pairs, and you can access them by an index of another type.
        It is useful when we need efficient implementation of search, insert and delete operations.

What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When does it occur?
Answer: Whenever we are trying to fetch any item of an array at an index which is not present in the array,
        it called ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.

What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
Answer: there are different ways of copying an array into another array. Using variable assignment is one of them,
        Create a new array of the same length and copy each element could be another way,
         Use the clone method of the array & Use System.arraycopy() method is another way.


What is DFS and BFS?
Answer: BFS is stands for Breadth First Search, and DFS stands Depth First Search.
        BFS uses Queue data structure for finding the shortest path. DFS uses Stack data structure.

What is Recursion?
Answer: A method that calls itself is known as a recursive method. And, this process is known as recursion.

What are linear and non-linear data Structures?
Answer: A linear data structure arranges the data items in an orderly manner where the elements are
        attached adjacently
        while a nonlinear data structure arranges data in sorted order, creating a relationship among the
        data elements.

Outline different sorting algorithms and their time complexities:

               Best        Avg         Worst
Selection Sort	Ω(n^2)	    θ(n^2)	    O(n^2)
Bubble Sort 	Ω(n)	    θ(n^2)	    O(n^2)
Insertion Sort	Ω(n)	    θ(n^2)	    O(n^2)
Heap Sort	    Ω(n log(n))	θ(n log(n))	O(n log(n))
Quick Sort	    Ω(n log(n))	θ(n log(n))	O(n^2)
Merge Sort	    Ω(n log(n))	θ(n log(n))	O(n log(n))
Bucket Sort     Ω(n+k)	    θ(n+k)	    O(n^2)
Radix Sort	    Ω(nk)	    θ(nk)	    O(nk)
Count Sort      Ω(n+k)	    θ(n+k)	    O(n+k)
